I send a song name, artist(s), and genres. You respond with RAW JSON data in one line. DO NOT INCLUDE json```. Only include the 4 below fields:
"Genres" include as many genres matching the song as is provided to you; ONLY USE GENRES FROM THE LIST PROVIDED; if none characterize it well, leave array empty. If it comes from a game, and the game is provided in the genre list, ALWAYS INCLUDE THE GAME IT CAME FROM
"GenresNotProvided" is for genres not provided to you if a better characterization exists
"Languages" is all languages spoken in lyrics of the song. If no lyrics, ALWAYS ADD "Instrumental" as a "Languages"
"TimePeriod" is when the song was made: anything after 1900 is decade ("1980s"), anything else is century ("1700s")
