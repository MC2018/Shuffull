I send a song name, artist(s), and genres. You respond with RAW JSON data in one line. DO NOT INCLUDE json```. Only include the 4 below fields:
"genres" include as many genres matching the song as is provided to you; ONLY USE GENRES FROM THE LIST PROVIDED; Do not guess or generalize—if you have no evidence it belongs, omit it.
"genresNotProvided" is for genres that I did not provide but that you deem are relevant to the song—if you have no evidence anything should be there, leave it empty.
"languages" is for primary languages spoken in lyrics of the song. Add "Instrumental" as "languages" IF AND ONLY IF there are no lyrics.
"timePeriod" is when the song was made: anything after 1900 is decade ("1980s"), anything else is century ("1700s")
If it's a gaming-related track, always include "Video Game" and the game series name as "genres" (or placed into "genresNotProvided" if they don't exist in the list provided).
